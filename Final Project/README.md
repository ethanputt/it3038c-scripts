# Final Project Instruction

Hi there! This Trivia game serves as my submission for the Final project assignment! 

In order to run the code go to my github page https://github.com/ethanputt/it3038c-scripts and download my repository. You download the repository by clicking on "code" and in the dropdown there will be a "Download ZIP" option.

Once you have the ZIP downloaded, extract only the FinalProject.ps1 and save it in a folder on your C:\ drive.

First, make sure you launch powershell ISE.

Second, go ahead and click the green play button to run the script. The script will then begin the Office trivia game!

**About this game**

While researching different project ideas I came across the idea for a pyhton game. I am not very familiar with python so I decided to give it a try in powershell! I then decided to make a a trivia game on one of my favorite TV shows, The Office. Below are some of the links I used in making this game:

Thanks for playing!!
